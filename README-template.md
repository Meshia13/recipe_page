## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I'm working on having a thorough understanding of the box model. I have to remember the order that it's in and it's relation to the content and page. This project also allowed me to play around with the flexbox layout in order to make the page responsive. Although this is considered an easy project, it did cause me to do some extra research into @media screen, and learning what needs adjustments for different device screens.

Code snippets, see below:

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 500px) {
  body {
    padding-top: 0;
  }

  h1 {
    margin-top: 1.5rem;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue learning how to make webpages responsive, flexbox and grid.
